### NOTE
Analysis of New Zeland COVID-19 vaccine data leaked by Barry Young to a US journalist who then made it public.

This data is NOT the original NZ data, but it is a derivative work. It contains no PII that matches any living or dead person. It does not violate any US law.

The [data](data) directory has the data released by Barry Young (obfuscated to remove any PII and dates have been shifted slightly so no PII is released).

The [code](code) directory has the file to run. Just do `python vax.py` after you `cd` to the `code` directory.

The [analysis](analysis) directory has an excel file where we've used the output data in pivot tables to show the 1 year mortality rates for each batch for each age range.

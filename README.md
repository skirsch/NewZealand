### New Zealand COVID-19 vaccine data (based on data released by Barry Young) 
Analysis of New Zeland COVID-19 vaccine data leaked by Barry Young to a US journalist who then made it public.

The [data](data) directory has the data released by Barry Young (obfuscated to remove any PII and dates have been shifted slightly so no PII is released).

The [code](code) directory has the file to run to do the batch analysis. Just do `python vax.py` after you `cd` to the `code` directory.

The [analysis](analysis) directory has an excel file where we've used the output data in pivot tables to show the 1 year mortality rates for each batch for each age range.

### Note
The data here is NOT the original NZ data, but it is a derivative work. 

It contains no PII that matches any living or dead person anywhere in the world.

It does not violate any US law including copyright law.
